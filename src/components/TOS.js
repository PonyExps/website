                        <p>
                        The Services comprise a platform that presents recipients with a set of one or more retailer virtual storefronts from which they can select goods for picking, packing, and delivery by volunteer couriers to your location. It also allows for volunteer couriers to view requests and fulfill these deliveries. In order to make this work, we need to share information about requests, including your name, city, zip code and requested retailer to all users. Recipients are also given the option to mark whether they are immunocompromised or elderly in order to receive priority delivery, which is information that will be available to all users. We also share phone numbers and/or emails with your recipient/courier so that you may get in contact to facilitate payment and delivery. When couriers volunteer to deliver, they have the option of posting this offer on a communal “thank you” board, which will make the courier’s name available to the public. However, the courier also has the option to make this post anonymously. Likewise, after a delivery is made, recipients may post a thank-you note to this board, which would share their name to the public, or to post this anonymously.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                For legal purposes: We may share your information when we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities, (b) prevent, detect, or otherwise handle fraud, security, or technical issues, and (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, the public, or PonyExpress.

                                To enable purchase of alcohol: When you buy alcohol using the Services, we may be required by law to share certain information with the retailer who makes the sale.

                            These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“ CCPA ”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights. The words used in this section have the meanings given to them in the CCPA, which may be broader than their common meaning. For example, the definition of “personal information” under the CCPA includes your name, but also more general information like age. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Notice of Collection.</strong> Although the information we collect is described in greater detail in Section A above, the categories of personal information that we collect – as described by the CCPA – are:</p>
                        <p>
                        Identifiers - including name, email address, and IP address.<br/>
                        Other individual customer records - including phone number and billing and shipping address. This category includes personal information protected under pre-existing California law (Cal. Civ. Code 1798.80(e)), and overlaps with other categories listed here. 
                        
                        Demographics - including your age. This category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other California or federal laws. 
                        <br></br>
                        Commercial information - including purchases and engagement with our Services.
